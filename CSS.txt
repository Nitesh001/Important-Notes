Important CSS selectors:

1. child, descendant and attribute selector

li.myClass + li{
  color:yellow
}

li.myClass ~ li{  /*matches all li that comes after .myClass*/
  color:green;
}

p[lang|="en"]{ /*selects all the tags where attribute 'lang' starts with 'en' */
  color: red;
}

p[lang~="more"]{ /*selects all the tags where attribute 'lang' has word 'more' in it with spaces */
  color:blue;
}

/*Similarly there are other tags. Like,
E[attr^=val] //attr value starts with 'val'
E[attr$=val] //attr value ends with 'val'
E[attr*=val] //String 'val' is a part of value of attribute
*/

2. Selector based on current state:
Three states are checked, disabled and enabled 

so, for checkbox

input[type='checkbox']:checked + label {
  color: purple;
}

But for input elements in HTML5, there are more states like, valid, invalid, required, optional, out-of-range, in-range

For eg, <input type="number" maximum=10 minimum=5 />

Any value not in this range will be invalid so,

input:invalid{
}

and 
input:out-of-range{
}

3. 'Style' tag can also be made contenteditable:
then in CSS:
[contenteditable] {
  -webkit-user-modify : read-write-plaintext-only;
}

4. Selectors based on position of elements w.r.t their parent in the DOM:
first-child,
last-child,
first-of-type,
last-of-type,
only-child,
only-of-type
nth-child,
nth-of-type,
nth-last-child,
nth-lst-of-type

like, 
div.myClass:nth-child(3n){  //Every third child
} 

div.myClass:nth-child(4){ //4th child from the top
}

div:nth-of-type(2){ //2nd div of any type of parent
}

div.myClass:nth-child(3n-1){
}

An awesome experiment:

li:first-of-type:last-of-type{ //It means, any li which is a first of its type and also last of its type means, there is only one li
  width:100%;
}

li:nth-of-type(1):nth-last-of-type(3){ //It means, any li which is a first of its type and also 3rd last from the bottom, it means there are 3 lis
  width:33.3%
}

A very good example of using nth-of-type is designing chess board.
like,
tr:nth-of-type(even) td:nth-of-type(even),
tr:nth-of-type(odd) td:nth-of-type(odd){
  background-color: black; //Here, background color should be black of all alternate elements
}
To generate star in CSS:
content : "\2605"

CSS Exclusion also available as:

div:not(.myExclude) //all divs except that have class myExclude
